# Predicting_Student_admission
Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks
In this notebook, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:

GRE Scores (Test)
GPA Scores (Grades)
Class rank (1-4)
The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/

Loading the data
To load the data and format it nicely, we will use two very useful packages called Pandas and Numpy. You can read on the documentation here:
